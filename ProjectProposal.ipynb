We choose domestic revenue and ticket sales as successfulness indicators of because they are the most direct numerical values that determine the popularity and success of a movie. At the end of our project, we hope to find a strong factor such that our finding may help the movie industry more efficient allocate resources but make more money. We found to prior research that are relevant to our topic:\n",

    "The first prior work is a project analyzing what factors make a movie with good votes on TMDB. The project decides to analyzes factors such as budget, revenue, genre, keywords, actors and directors and then it uses heat graphs, pie chart and frequency chart to show the correlation among the factors. In the end, the project builds a model to predict a film’s money earning power by its spects. The research team then assesses their model using linear regression to see how their prediction deviates from the real income.The core interest of this project is similar to ours. We use the same dataset. Yet the research is very movie-oriented - all the analysis are focused on movies. To enrich the discussion, our project will  focus more on movie revenues. We will take inflation into consideration and will probably distinguish the US box office and worldwide box office.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second research focuses exclusively on one aspect of a film that may influence a film’s revenue: Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb reviews. It comes up with a mathematical model that can quantify how effectively the online reviews tweaks a film’s revenue when given a specific film’s data. It then apply the formula to films with different ratings, genres, and released year etc. to see if the online reviews equally influence all films at all time. The report is intriguing in that it digs really in depth into one direction. It mathematical approach is illuminating. However, its narrow focus predetermined its inability to helping us accurately predict a film’s revenue, and this is where our project comes from. We will give a whole picture of how a film becomes successful. Namely, we will consider more factors and focus on how to predict box office.\n",

Thus the unknown proportion of each movie’s budget may affect our result. In addition, in order to advertise the movie better, sometimes the production companies may pay people to rate their movie with a higher rating, which may also twist the validity of our finding. \n",
